                <h5>Notes on 3Blue1Brown Lectures on the "Essence of Linear Algebra"</h5>

                <p>I have started season 1 of 4 of 3Blue1Brown's lecture on math. I'll at least go through all of season
                    one and two
                    before going back to the Computer Graphics lessons. If that's the Theory part of my study and I
                    don't have solid
                    foundations I think I'll regret it later.</p>

                <h3>Vectors | Chapter 1</h3>
                <img src="../Images/3B1B/3B1B-S01E01-01.png">
                <p>Vectors are written with [ ] to distinguish them from points ( ).</p>
                <img src="../Images/3B1B/3B1B-S01E01-02.png">
                <p>Numbers, multiplied by vectors, scale them. We can call any number a scalar.</p>

                <h3>Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors | Chapter 2</h3>
                <img src="../Images/3B1B/3B1B-S01E02-01.png">
                <p>Î - "I hat", the unit vector in the X axis.</p>
                <p>^j - "J hat", the unit vector in the Y axis.</p>
                <p>They are the Basis Vectors of the XY coordinate system.</p>
                <img src="../Images/3B1B/3B1B-S01E02-02.png">
                <p>The "span" is where the vectors can reach.</p>

                <h3>Linear transformations and matrices | Chapter 3</h3>
                <p>A Transformation is just a function that describes how to change one vector into another.</p>
                <img src="../Images/3B1B/3B1B-S01E03-01.png">
                <p>"Linear Transformations are a way to move around space such that gridlines remain parallel and evenly
                    spaced, and
                    such that the origin remains fixed."</p>

                <p>This one really did it for me, as I recognized the matrix shown from 3D transformations. And it is so
                    simple to
                    think about it as a rotation this way. Î (which describes x) was moved from [1, 0] to [0, 1], and ^J
                    (which
                    describes y) was moved from [0, 1] to [-1, 0]. And now we just multiply a vector by this, and we get
                    a that
                    vector rotated 90º!</p>

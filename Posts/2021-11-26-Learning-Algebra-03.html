    <h3>Three-dimensional linear transformations | Chapter 5</h3>
    <p>kÌ‚ (k hat) is the unit vector for the Z direction.</p>
    <p>A 3d vector transformation is the same as a 2D one, but with the extra dimension:</p>

    <p>You also multiply 3d matrices the same way. From right to left.</p>
    <h3>The determinant | Chapter 6</h3>
    <p>The determinant of a linear transformation is the scaling factor by which it changes any area:</p>

    <p>A negative determinant means space gets flipped over.</p>

    <h3>Inverse matrices, column space and null space | Chapter 7</h3>
    <p>For a matrix transformation A, the inverse of that is A^-1. And multiplying A by A^-1 (A inverse) is the
        equivalent of applying no transformation:</p>

    <p>This is also called the identity transformation. </p>

    <p>I didn't take a lot out of this chapter. I couldn't visualize how this would be useful for me, but I'm sure eventually I'll return here with a new found appreciation.</p>

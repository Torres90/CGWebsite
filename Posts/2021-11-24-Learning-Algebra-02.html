    <p>Composition is the product of two matrices.</p>
    <p>How to compute the product of two matrices:</p>
    <img src="Images/3B1B/3B1B-S01E04-02.png">
    <p>These are transformations that must be applied sequentially. From previous lessons, we know that each column in a
        matrix is the coordinate where î (i hat) and ^j (j hat) will be after the transformation. So, first we must
        transform the first column [e, g] of the first matrix M1, to see where î goes.</p>

    <p>And then we do the same for the second column [f, h] of the first matrix M1, to see where j^ will go.</p>

    <p>And that gives us our composition!</p>

    <p>A few properties of matrix multiplication:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's non-Commutative: Order maters. AB ≠ BA</li>
        <li>It's Associative: (AB)C = A(BC)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Done. Let's move to the 3D realm.</p>

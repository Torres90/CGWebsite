    <p>“Mr. Miyagi's fence lesson” is really long. But I supposed Daniel-san also spent some weeks painting those fences

    <h3>Modulo, % or mod()</h3>
    <p>Modulo finds the remainder of a division. It is abbreviated as mod, or represented by %.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 % 3 = 1</li>
        <li>5 % 3 = 2</li>
        <li>6 % 3 = 0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we plot <code>y = mod(x, 0.5)</code>:</p>
